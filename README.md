Design complex DNA geometries (human cell including chromosomes)


To design a new DNA molecule, to be used with molecularDNA (Geant4-DNA example) and the human cell geometry: 
1) run the "designHumanCellChromosome.py" 
2) run the "coordinatesToFractalDNA.py"


To view a plane of the new geometry:
1) run the "create2d.py"
2) run the "plotDNA.py"
